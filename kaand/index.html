    <h1> 'K' se... Kaand!!!</h1>
    <p>
        It's typical Sunday morning, I'm lying in my bed and there's nothing exciting happening in my life,No break-up of my male friends and no gossip from my female friends.
        <br> So now I have to take charge to make stuff that's exciting so I decided to yell to
my bestie about "How great I'm ! " (& Wait for her to roast me )
and yapp about super juniors but billion dollar question is :

<h3>are they really worthy to call "Super" ?</h3>

    </p>

    <p>
        Read it for <i><b>179.555</b> seconds</i> and you can decide yourself.

        <h2>1. Krantikari Kumar's (Rebellious Boys)</h2>
    It's my second session; where on stage of auditorium: it's classic <b>Boys v/s Girls</b> debate on whether <i>Cultural Event</i> should happen in college or not ?
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, if you're taking side that event's should not happen; logical argument flows like "It creates hindrance (disturbance) in studies" but no,it's our SUPER juniors.
        <br><br>
        They said," In events <i><b>'Eye-Contact'</b></i> happens between <u><i>opposite gender</i> </u>  which results into 'Connections' which results into disputes at home.

        <h2>2. Kaleshkari Kumaris ( No english word could replace feelings of Kalesh)</h2>
In auditorium,on the middle of stage there's one young handsome senior  placed as product and on right to him is girl and left to him is boy but these boy and girl need to <b>FIGHT</b> to take this product at home.
<br><br>
the girl simply said"Hu ane ghre lai jam ?(Can I take it home ?)
Areh didi woh ek commited banda hai aise kisi ke ghre chala jayega to bichare ke zindagi Mai tufaan a jayega na ?
<br><br>
Lekin kya kare hum to hai hi <b><u><i>"kaleshkari aurat!"</i></u></b>

        <h2>3. Krantikari Kalesh</h2> 
        But How do I pitch about community to these Krantikari & Kaleshkari people?
       <br> I'm deep into human behaviour,pschology and one thing I understood is<br> <i>we love <u>'gossips'</u></i>
       <br>so,how about planning kalesh in Krantikari manner ?

      so,yeah it was NSS oreintation and me and my darling are pitching why <b><i><u>NOT</u></i></b> to join NSS?
