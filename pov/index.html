  <h1>Super Juniors-Bridge Course Edition</h1>
  <p><strong></strong></p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The professor opened PPT, but my friend and I had a different plan: to <em>"day-dream."</em> Yes, that's the skill you will acquire first‚Äîhow to dream (or sleep) with open eyes in lectures. But there comes a moment when the professor is taking attendance. It's like the climax of the movie. But as the movie ended, my friend asked me,</p>
    <blockquote>"What's your perspective on our SUPER JUNIORS?"</blockquote>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Before We Begin</h2>
    <p>I'm just sharing my perspectives.</p>
    <blockquote>"Whenever man describes the world, he's describing himself."</blockquote>
    <p>I tried to reflect and observe as thoroughly as possible, but in case I missed you or your name‚Äîso sorry!</p>

    <h2>SUPER JUNIOR Highlights</h2>

    <h3>S: <span class="highlight">Self-confident Yash</span></h3>
    <p>In the auditorium, whenever a host asks for voluntary participation, at first instance no one responds, and then suddenly some people participate. Ever wonder "why?" Because it's not revealed what we have to do‚Äîthere's a certain kind of uncertainty.</p>
    <p>One aspect of confidence is having faith within to embrace any kind or certain kind of uncertainty. That's what makes YASH special: courage and confidence.</p>

    <h3>U: <span class="highlight">Unexpected Bhakti</span></h3>
    <p>When I'm on stage, I try to involve as many females as possible‚Äîthanks to my feminist friend who convinced me to do that. But the problem is, initially they don't come on stage‚Äîespecially when it's for business. No one comes. India needs many more Vineetas & Ghazals (Shark Tank).</p>
    <p>But in this situation, a girl came to participate. The ability to show up when no one is there, that itch to go against the flow‚Äîthat's what makes BHAKTI special.</p>

    <h3>P: <span class="highlight">Portrait Wala Leon</span></h3>
    <p>It's GenZ, where each kid will have 3 IDs: one main, one private, and one fake. But at the same time, there's a 4th kind‚Äîwhere you share with the world the craft you create. That's what Leon showed me when he met me.</p>
    <p>He's got some amazing portraits. Check them out. Perfection in craft‚Äîthat's what makes LEON special.</p>

    <h3>E: <span class="highlight">Evolving Pranjal</span></h3>
    <p>"We all are born with infinite possibilities within," but the question is‚Äîare we doing something to bring them outside?</p>
    <p>When I was in FPT class, Pranjal was shy to come. I guess she made a deal with me to participate only if I allowed her friend to come with her. But in the next class, she was shy too‚Äîbut she came herself.</p>
    <p>She's evolving class by class. That's what makes PRANJAL special: evolution from shy caterpillar to flying butterfly.</p>

    <h3>R: <span class="highlight">Really Helpful Samarth</span></h3>
    <p>All of you are new to campus‚Äîhow do you create friends? Compliment what you like, help with what you can.(bonus: roast, make fun, and tell stories).</p>
    <p>The first junior I remember is him. He complimented me on some session, helped me with photographs in class.</p>
    <p>But not the process‚Äîbut rather the authenticity in doing it‚Äîmakes SAMARTH special.</p>

    <h3>J: <span class="highlight">Jabari Priyal</span></h3>
    <p>I don't know how to articulate it, but my first friend from my bridge course (2023) and Priyal give me a similar kind of vibe‚Äîwhere they just go all in to mute the other person. That's what I observed.</p>
    <p>But it's not about saying"shut up" to others ‚Äîbut to be firm in carrying oneself. That trait certainly makes PRIYAL special.</p>

    <h3>U: <span class="highlight">Ur Senior: Param</span></h3>
    <p>If you're bored from the lecture (or this blog), sorry‚Äîmy default mode is nerdy on philosophy, human behaviour, psychology, and science-spirituality.</p>
    <p>But apart from the first day, the reason you're not seeing it on stage is all due to the grace of your senior: PARAM. He's a chill guy who converted this nerd to be a <em>bakchod</em> guy on stage.</p>
    <p><strong>Bolo Param Bhai ki Jai!!!</strong><br></p>

    <h3>N: <span class="highlight">New to Stage Diya</span></h3>
    <p>One thing to immediately do in college life: "Find a person who believes in you more than you believe in yourself."</p>
    <p>The friend who extends you for your growth. Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by those people‚Äîbe it Harshil, Dharmik, Henil, Rudra, or others.</p>
    <p>But Diya is one of them for her friends. She sits in the middle and sends her both friends on stage but never comes by herself‚Äîunless the last time her friend cheers for her.</p>
    <p>Telling her friends "pehle aap" ‚Äì makes DIYA special.<br><em>(As Diya is a common name‚ÄîI'm talking about NSS orientation session)</em></p>

    <h3>I: <span class="highlight">iismart Ishan</span></h3>
    <p>As organiser and being on stage where stakes are high, sometimes you miss what others from the audience can view as "common sense." That's what was happening‚Äîthe game was getting boring, but Ishan helped me with one suggestion to twist it.</p>
    <p>Smartness? No. Being <em>street-smart</em> and a <em>stud</em> guy makes ISHAN special.</p>

    <h3>O: <span class="highlight">Owesome Dhara</span></h3>
    <p>If someone asks me to describe engineering in one word: <strong>iteration</strong>‚Äîit's upgrading your product from version 1 to version 2.</p>
    <p>I've taken 2 classes in FPT. In the first class, a girl who was not ready to be judge (it's courtroom simulation) and speak her verdict‚Äîbecame a girl who spoke confidently and iterated the on-spot body language suggestion.</p>
    <p>But no, that's not why I used "owesome." But "her name is Dhara and she loves to fight (jk)"‚Äîthis sentence helped one of her classmates to remove fear of speaking. That's what makes DHARA special.</p>

    <h3>R: <span class="highlight">Rebelious Het</span></h3>
    <p>Now, it would be injustice to all of you if I complete my Super Junior article without mentioning Het. He's hilarious.</p>
    <p>Either you know him by his mischiefs, or soon you will know him‚Äîor you can go to AIDS class.</p>
    <p>Just being himself in front of people‚Äîthat's what makes HET special.</p>
