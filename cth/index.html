                        <p>I found Aysha in my quest for Finding Gems of ADIT. What got her selected wasn't that she's brilliant in something specific - she was honest with herself. She's like "I feel things very deeply but don't necessarily express it."</p>
                        <p>Often times I'm not able to express to a person how important they are - be it parents, gandu (my sister) or my friends. What's worse? Losing a friend without telling them how important they were.</p>
                        <p>But Aysha brought up a solution. If you listen to her "shabd" (word) carefully, you'll feel the 'shiddat' behind it. Her emotions aren't just emotions anymore - it's the creative energy behind everything.</p>
                        <div class="wisdom-quote">Make your emotions your driving force.</div>

                        <p>While you'll feel the shiddat behind Aysha's words, James brought in the Shayar's Soul.</p>
                        <p>I learned the structure of storytelling, and there's a certain way to do something. James does shayari in a way that looks exactly like a shayar's style of doing shayari.</p>

                        <p>For the longest period of my life, I was a person who doesn't celebrate much - whatever festivals or even my wins - because I thought of "what next" always.</p>
                        <p>But recently, while reading Inner Engineering by Sadhguru, he made me realize: if you're thirsty, you have to drink water, not see it. The only way to feel water is to drink water.</p>

                        <p>Will you agree that we all love to travel? I travel every day from my bus pickup point to college. The most thrilling experience is to be like a conductor - not to check tickets, but to feel the wind.</p>
                        <p>Prati's drawing could be felt. There's something behind it - she's gone an extra mile to make that effect. I don't understand drawing much, but it's great. Simply too good.</p>

                        <p>It's not about working daily - it's about running sprints. Whenever emotions are high, we get triggered, create art, then rest, get bored, and again create something.</p>

                        <p>I have a habit - I go to the garden, walk, and try to look at what's happening. When you pause and see, it looks really beautiful how nature works.</p>
                        <p>Richard Feynman said: "You see and I observe."</p>
                        <p>I observe, but more than me, I found Rutva very observational - be it starting her presentation with Ganesh ji painting or the eyes she made, but more than that, the insights she shared simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>She creates amazing drawings and signs them using "Meera" - her legal name might be Mithali. This brings me to a very important insight about creativity.</p>

                        <p>She was singing a song, but the audience was getting mood swings - sometimes giving good background music by clapping, sometimes not. It looks like life where we know we have to complete the song (life) - sometimes people will appreciate us, sometimes they'll ignore us.</p>
                        <div class="wisdom-quote">Nothing to take personally - when they're clapping, it's not because your art was great, it's due to dopamine hitting internally. Same way, if reactions aren't good, it's their cortisol.</div>
